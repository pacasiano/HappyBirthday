      When you this ehu girl, caused the crime
      You're my pretty little ehu girl

You set my heart on fire (Burn me up girl)
And now I don't know what to do
You set my heart on fire (Yeah)
And now I'm so in love with you my ehu girl
Pretty little ehu girl
Who made me a fool in love
Got my heart all in a whirl
And now it needs cooling off...
Said it happened last night
About 10 to 11 when I first laid eyes on you
We're standin' in line
Into Club Triple 7, it was just like heaven and a dream come true
We're standin' in the right place at the right time
When you this ehu girl, caused the crime
You're my pretty little ehu girl
Who made me a fool in love
Got my heart all in a whirl
And now it needs coolin' off
You set my heart on fire
And now I don't know what to do
You set my heart on fire
And now I'm so in love with you my ehu girl
Said I'm feelin' it now, something I've never felt
My heart's so hot, think I'm gonna melt
Somehow, I want to see you again my love
Sent from above, oh yeah!
And beautiful girls, yes, I've seen a few
But out of all the beauty in the world
There's no one quite like you
'Cause you're my pretty little ehu girl
Who made me a fool in love
Got my heart all in a whirl
And now it needs coolin' off
You set my heart on fire
And now I don't know what to do
You set my heart on fire
And now I'm so in love with you my ehu girl
My ehu girl
Ehu hair flows in the air
(The way your) Shinin' eyes reflect the sky
(The way your) Smile burns up my flame
But I don't know your name and I guess I'll call you my...
